	Invalid pin counts for a given frame:
		i.e. 38 or 83 this usually occurs when pins are not placed properly for second ball of the frame.
	bonus throw for frame 10 based on bowling rule as following
		X on frame 10 get 2 throw, first starts with 10 pins and second starts with the remaining pins from first throw (10 pins if first throw knock down all pints)
		/ on frame 10 get 1 throw that starts with 10 pins

		X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X||XX
	
	1.2 includes less than 10 frames
		X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X||XX
	
	1.3 includes invalid info for a given frame
		1.3.1 more than 2 inputs for a given frame
		1.3.2 X and / occurs in the same frame
		1.3.3 - occurs after X or / for a given frame (- can occurs after X in the bonus frame)
